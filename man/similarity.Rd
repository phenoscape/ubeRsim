\title{Compute semantic similarity metrics between terms}
\usage{
tanimoto_similarity(subsumer_mat = NA, terms = NULL, ...)

jaccard_similarity(subsumer_mat = NA, terms = NULL, ...)

cosine_similarity(subsumer_mat = NA, terms = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{subsumer_mat}{matrix or data.frame, the vector-encoded matrix M of
subsumers for which \eqn{M_{i,j} = W_i, W_i > 0}{M[i,j] = W[i], with W[i] > 0} (W = weights),
if class \emph{i} subsumes term j, and 0 otherwise. A binary
(\eqn{M_{i,j} \in \{0, 1\}}{M[i,j] in {0, 1}}) encoding (i.e., W[\emph{i}] = 1)
can be obtained from \code{\link[=subsumer_matrix]{subsumer_matrix()}}.}

\item{terms}{character, optionally the list of terms (as IRIs and/or labels)
for which to generate a properly encoded subsumer matrix on the fly.}

\item{...}{parameters to be passed on to \code{\link[=subsumer_matrix]{subsumer_matrix()}}
if a subsumer matrix is to be generated on the fly.}
}
\value{
A matrix with M[i,j] = similarity of terms \emph{i} and \emph{j}.

\description{
The Tanimoto similarity ST is computed according to the definition for bit vectors
(see \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index#Tanimoto's_definitions_of_similarity_and_distance}{Jaccard index at Wikipedia}).
For weights \eqn{W_i \in \{0, 1\}}{W[i] in {0, 1}} it is the same as the
Jaccard similarity.
The Tanimoto similarity can be computed for any term vectors, but for 1 - ST
to be a proper distance metric satisfying the triangle inequality,
\eqn{M_{i,j} \in \{0, W_i\}}{M[i,j] in {0, W[i]}} must hold.

The Jaccard similarity is computed using the Tanimoto similarity definition
for bit vectors
(see \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index#Tanimoto's_definitions_of_similarity_and_distance}{Jaccard index at Wikipedia}).
For the results to be a valid Jaccard similarity, weights must be zero and
one. If any weights are different, a warning is issued.

The Cosine similarity \emph{SC} is computed using the Euclidean dot product formula.
See \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity#Definition}{Cosine similarity on Wikipedia}.
The metric is valid for any term vectors (columns of the subsumer matrix), i.e.,
\eqn{M_{i,j} \in \{0, W_i\}}{M[i,j] in {0, W[i]}} is not required. Note that
1 - \emph{SC} is not a proper distance metric, because it violates the triangle
inequality. First convert to angle to obtain a distance metric.
